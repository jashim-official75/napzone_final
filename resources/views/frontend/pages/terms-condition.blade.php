                <p class="text-white">Obligatory Settlement: In small claims cases, where the conflict is not settled,
                    all further attempts to settle the dispute will be carried out solely through binding arbitration, as
                    defined in this section. You give up the right to litigate all cases in court before a judge or jury (or
                    engage in them as a party or class member). Instead, all disputes will be decided before a neutral
                    arbitrator whose verdict will be binding, with the exception of the restricted right of appeal provided
                    for under the Federal Arbitration Act or some other relevant statute. The arbitrator's award will be
                    imposed by any court having authority over the parties.</p>
                <p class="text-white"><b>Exclusions to Settlement:</b> You and NapZone Games agree that the following

                <ul class="text-white">

                        any of your intellectual property rights or those of NapZone Games</li>
                    <li class="ml-5">Any injunctive relief claim.</li>

                <p class="text-white"><b>Class Action Waiver:</b> Any action in any court to settle or litigate any
                    conflict would be carried out exclusively on an individual basis. Neither you nor we would try to get
                    any case heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which any side acts in a legislative
                    capacity or intends to act. Until the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations
                    or prosecutions, no arbitration or proceeding shall be merged with another.</p>
                <p class="text-white"><b>Settlement Measures:</b> The Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service
                    ('JAMS') shall perform such arbitration according to the relevant Customer or Commercial Arbitration
                    Laws in place at the time the case is filed. If JAMS is unable or unable to perform arbitration of the
                    conflict, all sides may voluntarily negotiate on an alternative arbitration service provider. By
                    following the JAMS rules, you can order a telephonic or in-person hearing. In a case costing $10,000 or
                    less, whether the arbitrator sees good reason to hold an in-person hearing instead, the hearing would be
                    telephonic. The arbitrator can personally award the same damages to you as a court would. The arbitrator
                    can grant relief only to you personally and only to the degree appropriate for your particular claim to
                    be fulfilled.</p>
                <p class="text-white"><b>Arbitrator’s Jurisdiction:</b> The arbitrator shall have the authority to
                    decide on the existence, extent, or legitimacy of the arbitration arrangement or the arbitrability of
                    any argument or counterclaim, including any objection to his or her own jurisdiction.</p>
                <p class="text-white"><b>Arbitration Fees:</b> The original arbitration fee is paid by whoever files the
                    arbitration. We pay if we file. When you apply, you pay unless, under the applicable arbitration rules,
                    you get a charge waiver. The other payments shall be allocated in compliance with the arbitration firm's
                    guidelines and relevant legislation. - A party shall pay the costs of the council, consultants, and
                    witnesses of that party and other expenditures, irrespective of which party prevails, except if the
                    arbitrator, following relevant law, so decides, a party may reclaim any or all expenses from another
                    party.</p>
                <p class="text-white"><b>Disagreements Must Be Filed Within One Year:</b> To the degree allowed by
                    statute, any dispute pursuant to this Arrangement must be filed in a small claims court or arbitration
                    proceeding within one year. The one-year cycle starts when it is practicable to file the Dispute or
                    Notice of Dispute first. If, after one year, a dispute is not filed, it is automatically barred.</p>
                <p class="text-white"><b>Provisional Injunctive Relief:</b> Any party can request temporary injunctive
                    relief in any court of appropriate jurisdiction prior to the appointment of an arbitrator without
                    waiving its right to arbitration.</p>
                <p class="text-white">If this arbitration arrangement is considered to be unconstitutional or
                    unenforceable, the parties agree to the fullest degree permissible under the relevant statute that, in
                    compliance with Section IX, any disagreement relating to your use of the Facilities or these Provisions
                    shall be instituted and heard.</p>
                <p class="list-heading font-weight-bold">xi. Miscellaneous</p>
                <p class="text-white"><b>All-inclusive Agreement:</b> These Terms represent a whole arrangement between
                    you and us, superseding all previous or contemporaneous (oral, literary, or electronic) correspondence
                    and suggestions between you and us.</p>
                <p class="text-white"><b>Relationship of Parties:</b> You accept that as a result of these conditions
                    or your access to and use of the facilities, no joint venture, collaboration, job, or organization
                    arrangement exists between you and us.</p>
                <p class="text-white"><b>Severability:</b> This clause shall be severed if any provision of these Terms
                    is considered to be unconstitutional or unenforceable. The majority of the terms and conditions will
                    remain in full power and effect. An enforceable provision that comes nearest to the purpose behind the
                    invalid provision will override the severed provision.</p>
                <p class="text-white"><b>Assignment:</b> Without the prior written permission of NapZone Games this
                    Arrangement will not be assigned, in whole or in part, whether knowingly, by statute, or otherwise, to
                    you. NapZone Games may, without constraint, assign, authorize, delegate, or otherwise move to any third
                    party its rights or obligations clause. Subject to the preceding sentences, the rights and liabilities
                    of the parties to this Agreement shall be binding on the parties and their respective successors and
                    authorized assigns and shall insure them to the benefit of them. Any attempted assignment other than
                    that referred to in this section shall be null and void.</p>
                <p class="text-white"><b>Captions and Headings:</b> The titles and headings of the sections and
                    paragraphs used in the Terms shall be inserted only for convenience and shall not affect the meaning or
                    interpretation of the Terms.</p>
                <p class="text-white">Waiver: Our failure to uphold or respond to any violation of any of the
                    provisions of these Terms by any party does not waive our right to subsequently enforce any of the terms
                    or conditions of the Terms or to react to any violations.</p>
