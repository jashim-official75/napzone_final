                <p class="text-white">NapZone Games offers you a variety of options to regulate the use and sharing of
                    your data, including:</p>
                <p class="text-white">Communications by Email: You can opt out of receiving commercial email messages
                    from us by following the instructions provided in our emails to unsubscribe. Please notice that you can
                    continue to receive messages related to your account, your purchases, and similar service-related
                    messages even if you have opted out of receiving commercial email messages.</p>
                <p class="text-white">Data for Geolocation: Your system can allow you to monitor the collection, through
                    the settings on your device, of your precise geolocation data and whether this information is shared
                    with third parties. Please note that to opt out of providing specific location information, you will
                    need to change several settings, and not just your location permissions. We may continue to derive your
                    estimated location from your IP address and other information we may gather if you opt out of providing
                    accurate geolocation information. Please check your computer settings for more details.</p>
                <p class="text-white">Similar Technologies and Cookies: By changing your web browser settings, you can
                    be able to reject or disable cookies. Since each web browser is different, please consult your web
                    browser's instructions (typically in the "help" section). Please note that to reject or disable local
                    storage and similar technologies, you will need to take additional measures. Adobe Local Shared Objects,
                    for instance, can be managed through the Adobe Setting Manager page instructions. In some cases,
                    deleting your browser's cookies can cancel your interest-based advertising options. If you choose to
                    deny, disable, or uninstall cookies and similar technologies, you might no longer have access to any of
                    the services' features.</p>
                <p class="text-white">Do Not Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms: Some web browsers can transmit to the
                    websites with which the user communicates "do-not-track" signals. Currently, NapZone Games is not taking
                    action in response to these signals.</p>
                <p class="text-white">Interest-Based Advertising: Although it is not possible to turn off all
                    advertisements, you have the option to monitor whether you receive interest-based ads over time and
                    through unaffiliated sites and services and your various devices based on information collected or
                    obtained about your online activities and interests. By following the guidelines given on their
                    websites, you can opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements from companies involved in
                    self-regulatory initiatives such as the Network Advertising Initiative (US) and the Digital Advertising
                    Alliance (US), EDAA (EU), and DAAC (Canada). You will also need to opt out of interest-based ads on your
                    mobile device or via the mobile application if you are using a mobile app. Check the settings for your
                    computer and mobile app for more detail. Please note that when you opt out, your opt-out option will
                    apply only to the browser and computer that you are using.</p>
                <p class="text-white">Other Game and Device Permissions: You may be able to change your privacy settings
                    within the Services or your system permissions for push alerts, address book sharing, and other details
                    or functions. For more details, please check the settings for the services and your computer. You can
                    uninstall a game by using the normal uninstall procedure that is available on your computer or the

                <p class="text-white">Data Rights and Withdrawal of Consent: Your country's laws can give you the right
                    to request access to, correct, block, port, copy or remove your information, request that we stop
                    processing your information or delete your account, or to withdraw or alter the scope of your consent.
                    We will avoid processing your information for certain purposes if you revoke your consent, but it will
                    not impact the processing of information already protected by your consent. Where technologically
                    feasible and necessary by applicable law, we will, on your fair request, port your data. Your failure to
                    access the services or any of its features can result from a request to withdraw consent, limit or stop
                    processing your information, or remove your account or information. Please contact us in order to
                    exercise your rights consistent with applicable law.</p>

                    physical, electronic, organizational, and procedural safeguards. While we take reasonable precautions
                    against possible loss, misuse or unauthorized access, it is not possible to guarantee the security of
                    any storage system or data transmission over the internet. The data we obtain will only be kept for as
                    long as it is reasonably appropriate for the purposes set out above, unless otherwise needed by
                    applicable law.</p>

                    processing to those countries in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For the provision of our services
                    and the performance of the Terms of Service and End User License Agreement, these transfers are
                    necessary.</p>

                    posting the updated policy via the Services or otherwise in compliance with applicable law before such
