	<meta name="description" content="The Tic Tac Toe game offers you a few options: play against the computer (which can be set at three different levels), and play with friends in multiplayer mode via a WiFi network!. If X plays a center move, you should play the corner move. This is because you are forcing &quot;X&quot; to block in the next move. X.O.X.O. both players are. That means the game is over. B.O.T. allows you to play tic tac toe multiplayer against the bot at 3 levels of difficulty.  These descriptions focus on grid games like the one illustrated above when each player begins with four &quot;markers&quot; (Xs or Os) that they place on an empty 3Ã—3 grid which is either drawn on a sheet of paper or played on a flat surface. The grid can be any 3-dimensional shape, and it can be played on a triangular sheet and a square one. ">
