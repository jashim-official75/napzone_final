	"description": "The Tic Tac Toe game offers you a few options: play against the computer (which can be set at three different levels), and play with friends in multiplayer mode via a WiFi network!. If X plays a center move, you should play the corner move. This is because you are forcing \"X\" to block in the next move. X.O.X.O. both players are. That means the game is over. B.O.T. allows you to play tic tac toe multiplayer against the bot at 3 levels of difficulty.  These descriptions focus on grid games like the one illustrated above when each player begins with four \"markers\" (Xs or Os) that they place on an empty 3Ã—3 grid which is either drawn on a sheet of paper or played on a flat surface. The grid can be any 3-dimensional shape, and it can be played on a triangular sheet and a square one. ",
