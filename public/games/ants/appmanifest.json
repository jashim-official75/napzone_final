These are coming at you to keep them in a warm place in the ant nest. So it's not a good idea to keep them waiting and help them reach their destination! What are you doing for these little ants?   They're coming for the ant war! So be careful and quick! You'll have to match the color of your ant with its respective shelter. The time is limited since they won't stop coming. So be focused on their colors, or else it'll get tricky!",
