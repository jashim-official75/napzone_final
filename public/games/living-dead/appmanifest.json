	"description": "The game starts with Farus walking through the streets of Dhaka city holding a gun. Zombies will begin to appear, and the player must shoot the zombies before the zombies touch Farus, which will reduce his health. After shooting a few numbers of zombies, the first boss will appear. The first Crawler will shoot Farus, so the player must dodge the bullets; otherwise, it will damage Farusâ€™s health very severely.",
